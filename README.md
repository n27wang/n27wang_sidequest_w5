## Description

This project is an interactive story built with p5.js that unfolds through multiple game states across separate files. The experience is structured as a small branching decision tree, where the player makes choices that influence how the story progresses. Each screen represents a different narrative moment, and player actions lead to different paths and outcomes rather than a single linear ending.
To deepen the interaction, the game tracks persistent player stats such as karma, trust, and health across scenes. These values reflect the player’s decisions and are used to determine which ending is unlocked, reinforcing the idea that choices have consequences within the system.

## Learning Goals

Practice building a multi-file p5.js project using a state-based structure to manage screens and game flow

Learn how to track and update player variables across scenes to create persistent consequences

Understand how game mechanics (stats and endings) can be used to express narrative meaning and emotion

Improve code organization and readability by separating logic into distinct files and states
