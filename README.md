## Description

--- This project explores how camera movement alone can create an emotional experience. Instead of controlling a player, the camera slowly scrolls through a world larger than the screen. The pacing intentionally changes throughout the experience, slowing down in the middle to create a reflective pause. Subtle floating elements and soft gradients are used to evoke a calm, meditative atmosphere. Small hidden symbols are placed throughout the world for the camera to “discover,” encouraging quiet observation rather than active gameplay.


## Learning Goals

Practice separating world space and camera/view state.

Understand how translate() can simulate camera movement.

Explore pacing as a design tool rather than relying on player interaction.

Use motion, color, and layering to evoke emotion.

Experiment with subtle interactivity (discovery mechanics) without traditional gameplay.

## Assets

N/A

## GenAI

--- GenAI (ChatGPT) was used to brainstorm structural approaches for implementing an automatic scrolling camera and refining pacing strategies. The final emotional tone, visual decisions, pacing adjustments, and symbol placement were chosen and modified by the author. The code was reviewed, tested, and adjusted manually to ensure it met assignment requirements.
